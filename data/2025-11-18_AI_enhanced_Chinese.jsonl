However, existing formulations model the robot as a non-volumetric point, but in practice a robot interacts with the environment through its body and sensors with physical volume. In this work, we introduce a new ergodic control formulation that optimizes spatial coverage using a volumetric state representation. Our method preserves the asymptotic coverage guarantees of ergodic control, adds minimal computational overhead for real-time control, and supports arbitrary sample-based volumetric models. We evaluate our method across search and manipulation tasks -- with multiple robot dynamics and end-effector geometries or sensor models -- and show that it improves coverage efficiency by more than a factor of two while maintaining a 100% task completion rate across all experiments, outperforming the standard ergodic control method. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a robot arm performing mechanical erasing tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Ergodic control is adapted for robots with physical volume, improving coverage efficiency by over twofold while maintaining task completion.", "motivation": "Existing ergodic control models robots as points, ignoring their physical volume and sensor interactions, which is unrealistic for practical applications.", "method": "Introduce a new ergodic control formulation that uses a volumetric state representation, preserving asymptotic coverage guarantees and adding minimal computational overhead.

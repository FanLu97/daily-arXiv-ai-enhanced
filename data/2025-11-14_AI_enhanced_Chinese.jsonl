Then, intrinsic rewards encourage the agent to perform novel hand motions, and follow its hands with its gaze. A curriculum learning setup from single-hand to dual-hand training allows the agent to reach complex visual-motor coordination.

However, the realization of the generated motion plans is often compromised by a ''task-execution mismatch'', where unmodeled dynamics, persistent disturbances, and system latency cause the robot's actual task-space state to diverge from the desired motion trajectory. We propose a novel task-level robust control architecture, L1-augmented Dynamical Systems (L1-DS), that explicitly handles the task-execution mismatch in tracking a nominal motion plan generated by any DS-based LfD scheme. Our framework augments any DS-based LfD model with a nominal stabilizing controller and an L1 adaptive controller. Furthermore, we introduce a windowed Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)-based target selector, which enables the nominal stabilizing controller to handle temporal misalignment for improved phase-consistent tracking.

Paper Website: (https://usahai18.github.io/stein_clarity/)", "summary": "Autonomous robots are increasingly deployed for information-gathering tasks in environments that vary across space and time. Planning informative and safe trajectories in such settings is challenging because information decays when regions are not revisited. Most existing planners model information as static or uniformly decaying, ignoring environments where the decay rate varies spatially; those that model non-uniform decay often overlook how it evolves along the robot's motion, and almost all treat safety as a soft penalty. In this paper, we address these challenges. We model uncertainty in the environment using clarity, a normalized representation of differential entropy from our earlier work that captures how information improves through new measurements and decays over time when regions are not revisited. Building on this, we present Stein Variational Clarity-Aware Informative Planning, a framework that embeds clarity dynamics within trajectory optimization and enforces safety through a low-level filtering mechanism based on our earlier gatekeeper framework for safety verification.

To systematically analyze this issue, we propose ParaBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate both text and image output modalities. Our analysis using ParaBench reveals that this performance degradation is strongly correlated with poor alignment between the generated reasoning and the final image. To resolve this, we propose a parallel multimodal diffusion framework, MMaDA-Parallel, that enables continuous, bidirectional interaction between text and images throughout the entire denoising trajectory. MMaDA-Parallel is trained with supervised finetuning and then further optimized by Parallel Reinforcement Learning (ParaRL), a novel strategy that applies semantic rewards along the trajectory to enforce cross-modal consistency. Experiments validate that our model significantly improves cross-modal alignment and semantic consistency, achieving a 6.9\\% improvement in Output Alignment on ParaBench compared to the state-of-the-art model, Bagel, establishing a more robust paradigm for thinking-aware image synthesis.

Inspired by these biological features, we present PuffyBot, an untethered shape morphing robot capable of changing its body morphology to navigate multiple environments. Our robot design leverages a scissor-lift mechanism driven by a linear actuator as its primary structure to achieve shape morphing. The transformation enables a volume change from 255.00 cm3 to 423.75 cm3, modulating the buoyant force to counteract a downward force of 3.237 N due to 330 g mass of the robot. A bell-crank linkage is integrated with the scissor-lift mechanism, which adjusts the servo-actuated limbs by 90 degrees, allowing a seamless transition between crawling and swimming modes. The robot is fully waterproof, using thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) fabric to ensure functionality in aquatic environments. The robot can operate untethered for two hours with an onboard battery of 1000 mA h. Our experimental results demonstrate multi-environment locomotion, including crawling on the land, crawling on the underwater floor, swimming on the water surface, and bimodal buoyancy adjustment to submerge underwater or resurface.

Computer vision could greatly aid this research, but existing methods often rely on human-centric pretrained models and focus on single datasets, which limits generalization. We address this limitation by shifting from a model-centric to a data-centric approach and introduce PriVi, a large-scale primate-centric video pretraining dataset. PriVi contains 424 hours of curated video, combining 174 hours from behavioral research across 11 settings with 250 hours of diverse web-sourced footage, assembled through a scalable data curation pipeline. We pretrain V-JEPA on PriVi to learn primate-specific representations and evaluate it using a lightweight frozen classifier. Across four benchmark datasets, ChimpACT, BaboonLand, PanAf500, and ChimpBehave, our approach consistently outperforms prior work, including fully finetuned baselines, and scales favorably with fewer labels. These results demonstrate that primate-centric pretraining substantially improves data efficiency and generalization, making it a promising approach for low-label applications.

It occurs on a continuum from mild to severe, and treatment options can vary based on severity. Assessment of severity involves a clinician's expert judgment, which is costly and can vary widely in reliability. In this work, we present the first method for automatically classifying phonotrauma severity from vocal fold images. To account for the ordinal nature of the labels, we adopt a widely used ordinal regression framework. To account for label uncertainty, we propose a novel modification to ordinal regression loss functions that enables them to operate on soft labels reflecting annotator rating distributions. Our proposed soft ordinal regression method achieves predictive performance approaching that of clinical experts, while producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates.

However, these models apply each instruction in the prompt with a fixed strength, limiting the user's ability to precisely and continuously control the intensity of individual edits. We introduce SliderEdit, a framework for continuous image editing with fine-grained, interpretable instruction control. Given a multi-part edit instruction, SliderEdit disentangles the individual instructions and exposes each as a globally trained slider, allowing smooth adjustment of its strength. Unlike prior works that introduced slider-based attribute controls in text-to-image generation, typically requiring separate training or fine-tuning for each attribute or concept, our method learns a single set of low-rank adaptation matrices that generalize across diverse edits, attributes, and compositional instructions. This enables continuous interpolation along individual edit dimensions while preserving both spatial locality and global semantic consistency.

This multi-modality integration allows VLA models to interpret complex, real-world environments using diverse sensor data streams. Given the fact that VLA-based systems heavily rely on the sensory input, the security of VLA models against physical-world sensor attacks remains critically underexplored.\n  To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of physical sensor attacks against VLAs, quantifying the influence of sensor attacks and investigating the defenses for VLA models. We introduce a novel ``Real-Sim-Real'' framework that automatically simulates physics-based sensor attack vectors, including six attacks targeting cameras and two targeting microphones, and validates them on real robotic systems. Through large-scale evaluations across various VLA architectures and tasks under varying attack parameters, we demonstrate significant vulnerabilities, with susceptibility patterns that reveal critical dependencies on task types and model designs. We further develop an adversarial-training-based defense that enhances VLA robustness against out-of-distribution physical perturbations caused by sensor attacks while preserving model performance.

A regression branch is incorporated into the model for precise feature extraction, while a consolidation mechanism combines these maps based on similarity scores to produce a robust final result. An event-driven sampling technique, utilizing the Farneback optical flow algorithm, is introduced to selectively capture frames showing significant crowd movements, reducing computational load and storage by focusing on critical crowd dynamics. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including overlay plots and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the model demonstrates its ability to effectively capture crowd dynamics in both dense and sparse settings. The efficiency of the sampling method is further assessed, showcasing its capability to decrease frame counts while maintaining essential crowd events.

Supplementary material included", "summary": "Indoor localization in GPS-denied environments is crucial for applications like emergency response and assistive navigation. Vision-based methods such as PALMS enable infrastructure-free localization using only a floor plan and a stationary scan, but are limited by the short range of smartphone LiDAR and ambiguity in indoor layouts. We propose PALMS$+$, a modular, image-based system that addresses these challenges by reconstructing scale-aligned 3D point clouds from posed RGB images using a foundation monocular depth estimation model (Depth Pro), followed by geometric layout matching via convolution with the floor plan. PALMS$+$ outputs a posterior over the location and orientation, usable for direct or sequential localization. Evaluated on the Structured3D and a custom campus dataset consisting of 80 observations across four large campus buildings, PALMS$+$ outperforms PALMS and F3Loc in stationary localization accuracy -- without requiring any training. Furthermore, when integrated with a particle filter for sequential localization on 33 real-world trajectories, PALMS$+$ achieved lower localization errors compared to other methods, demonstrating robustness for camera-free tracking and its potential for infrastructure-free applications.

Traditional static friction models (such as the Stribeck model) are widely used due to their simple forms; however, they typically require predefined functional assumptions, which poses significant challenges when dealing with unknown functional structures. To address this issue, this paper proposes a physics-inspired machine learning approach based on the Kolmogorov Arnold Network (KAN) for static friction modeling of robotic joints. The method integrates spline activation functions with a symbolic regression mechanism, enabling model simplification and physical expression extraction through pruning and attribute scoring, while maintaining both high prediction accuracy and interpretability. We first validate the method's capability to accurately identify key parameters under known functional models, and further demonstrate its robustness and generalization ability under conditions with unknown functional structures and noisy data. Experiments conducted on both synthetic data and real friction data collected from a six-degree-of-freedom industrial manipulator show that the proposed method achieves a coefficient of determination greater than 0.95 across various tasks and successfully extracts concise and physically meaningful friction expressions.

Deep learning models have recently achieved promising results by implicitly learning such patterns from 2D trajectory data. However, most approaches treat pedestrians as point entities, ignoring the physical space that each person occupies. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model that enhances the Social LSTM with a new Dynamic Occupied Space loss function. This loss function guides Social LSTM in learning to avoid realistic collisions without increasing displacement error across different crowd densities, ranging from low to high, in both homogeneous and heterogeneous density settings. Such a function achieves this by combining the average displacement error with a new collision penalty that is sensitive to scene density and individual spatial occupancy. For efficient training and evaluation, five datasets were generated from real pedestrian trajectories recorded during the Festival of Lights in Lyon 2022. Four datasets represent homogeneous crowd conditions -- low, medium, high, and very high density -- while the fifth corresponds to a heterogeneous density distribution. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed model not only lowers collision rates but also enhances displacement prediction accuracy in each dataset. Specifically, the model achieves up to a 31% reduction in the collision rate and reduces the average displacement error and the final displacement error by 5% and 6%, respectively, on average across all datasets compared to the baseline. Moreover, the proposed model consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art deep learning models across most test sets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86Social LSTM\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u5360\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4eba\u7fa4\u4e2d\u884c\u4eba\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u884c\u4eba\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u573a\u666f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53ca\u4e2a\u4f53\u7a7a\u95f4\u5360\u636e\u654f\u611f\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4f4d\u79fb\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u62e5\u6324\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c realistic pedestrian trajectory prediction \u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86 promising results\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5c06\u884c\u4eba\u89c6\u4e3a\u70b9\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u6240\u5360\u636e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u5360\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08Dynamic Occupied Space\uff09\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u589e\u5f3aSocial LSTM\u3002\u8be5\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\uff08average displacement error\uff09\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u60e9\u7f5a\uff08collision penalty\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u60e9\u7f5a\u5bf9\u573a\u666f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u7a7a\u95f4\u5360\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u78b0\u649e\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4e94\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u6765\u81ea\u6cd5\u56fd\u91cc\u66022022\u5e74\u706f\u5149\u8282\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u884c\u4eba\u8f68\u8ff9\uff09\u4e0a\u90fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4f4d\u79fb\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u5c06\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe31%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u4e865%\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u4e866%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u51e0\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5360\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6307\u5bfcSocial LSTM\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u907f\u514d\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u78b0\u649e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4eba\u7fa4\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff08\u4ece\u4f4e\u5230\u9ad8\uff09\u548c\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5747\u5300\u548c\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff09\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

On the D4RL benchmark, UEPO achieves +5.9\\% absolute improvement over Uni-O4 on locomotion tasks and +12.4\\% on dexterous manipulation, demonstrating strong generalization and scalability.", "AI": {"tldr": "UEPO\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u7ebf\u5230\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08O2O-RL\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u6001\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u5b50\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u6355\u6349\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u6563\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u673a\u5236\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728D4RL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cUEPO\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6bd4Uni-O4\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e865.9%\uff0c\u5728\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8612.4%\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u7ebf\u5230\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08O2O-RL\uff09\u4e2d\u6709\u9650\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u6001\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUEPO\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u501f\u9274\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1. \u591a\u79cd\u5b50\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u6355\u6349\u591a\u79cd\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u6001\uff1b2. \u52a8\u6001\u6563\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b3. \u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "UEPO\u5728D4RL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6210\u679c\uff1a\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6bd4Uni-O4\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e865.9%\uff0c\u5728\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8612.4%\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "UEPO\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u89e3\u51b3O2O-RL\u7684\u6311\u6218\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6210\u679c\u3002"}}

We investigate two fundamental priors for improving learning efficiency: decomposing manipulation trajectories into sequential alignment and interaction phases, and retrieval-based generalisation. Through 3,450 real-world rollouts, we systematically study this decomposition. We compare different design choices for the alignment and interaction phases, and examine generalisation and scaling trends relative to today's dominant paradigm of behavioural cloning with a single-phase monolithic policy. In the few-demonstrations-per-task regime (<10 demonstrations), decomposition achieves an order of magnitude improvement in data efficiency over single-phase learning, with retrieval consistently outperforming behavioural cloning for both alignment and interaction. Building on these insights, we develop Multi-Task Trajectory Transfer (MT3), an imitation learning method based on decomposition and retrieval. MT3 learns everyday manipulation tasks from as little as a single demonstration each, whilst also generalising to novel object instances. This efficiency enables us to teach a robot 1,000 distinct everyday tasks in under 24 hours of human demonstrator time. Through 2,200 additional real-world rollouts, we reveal MT3's capabilities and limitations across different task families.

It remains unclear how pre-training domain (medical vs. general), paradigm (e.g., text-guided), and architecture influence embedding quality, hindering the selection of optimal encoders for specific radiology tasks. To address this, we evaluate vision encoders from eight medical and general-domain FMs for chest X-ray analysis. We benchmark classification (pneumothorax, cardiomegaly) and segmentation (pneumothorax, cardiac boundary) using linear probing and fine-tuning. Our results show that domain-specific pre-training provides a significant advantage; medical FMs consistently outperformed general-domain models in linear probing, establishing superior initial feature quality. However, feature utility is highly task-dependent. Pre-trained embeddings were strong for global classification and segmenting salient anatomy (e.g., heart). In contrast, for segmenting complex, subtle pathologies (e.g., pneumothorax), all FMs performed poorly without significant fine-tuning, revealing a critical gap in localizing subtle disease. Subgroup analysis showed FMs use confounding shortcuts (e.g., chest tubes for pneumothorax) for classification, a strategy that fails for precise segmentation. We also found that expensive text-image alignment is not a prerequisite; image-only (RAD-DINO) and label-supervised (Ark+) FMs were among top performers. Notably, a supervised, end-to-end baseline remained highly competitive, matching or exceeding the best FMs on segmentation tasks.

However, existing benchmarks still rely on rule-based reactive agents such as the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), which lack behavioral diversity and fail to capture realistic human interactions, leading to oversimplified traffic dynamics. To address these limitations, we present nuPlan-R, a new reactive closed-loop planning benchmark that integrates learning-based reactive multi-agent simulation into the nuPlan framework. Our benchmark replaces the rule-based IDM agents with noise-decoupled diffusion-based reactive agents and introduces an interaction-aware agent selection mechanism to ensure both realism and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we extend the benchmark with two additional metrics to enable a more comprehensive assessment of planning performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our reactive agent model produces more realistic, diverse, and human-like traffic behaviors, leading to a benchmark environment that better reflects real-world interactive driving.

To address these limi- tations, we propose STORM (Segment, Track, and Object Re-localization from a single 3D Model), an open-source robust real-time 6D pose estimation system that requires no manual annotation. STORM employs a novel three-stage pipeline combining vision-language understanding with self-supervised feature matching: contextual object descriptions guide localization, self-cross-attention mechanisms identify candidate regions, and a segmentation model produces precise masks for accurate pose estimation. Another key innovation is our automatic re-registration mechanism that detects tracking failures through feature similarity monitoring and recovers from severe occlusions or rapid motion. STORM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging industrial datasets featuring multi-object occlusions, high-speed motion, and varying illumination, while operating at real-time speeds without additional training.

While pre-trained models (PTMs) are increasingly leveraged for EFCL, existing methods often overlook the inherent imbalance of real-world data distributions. We discovered that real-world data streams commonly exhibit dual-level imbalances, dataset-level distributions combined with extreme or reversed skews within individual tasks, creating both intra-task and inter-task disparities that hinder effective learning and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose PANDA, a Patch-and-Distribution-Aware Augmentation framework that integrates seamlessly with existing PTM-based EFCL methods. PANDA amplifies low-frequency classes by using a CLIP encoder to identify representative regions and transplanting those into frequent-class samples within each task. Furthermore, PANDA incorporates an adaptive balancing strategy that leverages prior task distributions to smooth inter-task imbalances, reducing the overall gap between average samples across tasks and enabling fairer learning with frozen PTMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate PANDA's capability to work with existing PTM-based CL methods, improving accuracy and reducing catastrophic forgetting.", "AI": {"tldr": "EFCL\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff08PTMs\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684PANDA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u4f4e\u9891\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u8861\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709PTM-based EFCL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u53cc\u91cd\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6027\uff08\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ea7\u522b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u6216\u53cd\u5411\u504f\u659c\uff09\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPANDA\uff08Patch-and-Distribution-Aware Augmentation\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1. \u4f7f\u7528CLIP\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u79fb\u690d\u5230\u9ad8\u9891\u7c7b\u522b\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u4f4e\u9891\u7c7b\u522b\u30022. \u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u8861\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5148\u524d\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u5e73\u6ed1\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u5e73\u5747\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "result": "PANDA\u80fd\u591f\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684PTM-based CL\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PANDA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709PTM-based CL\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Although robotic solutions have the potential to improve operational safety and effectiveness, current systems still lack reliable autonomy and fault management capabilities. To address this gap, we propose a control framework for dependable robotized bolting tasks and instantiate it on a specific robotic system. The system features a control architecture ensuring accurate driving torque control and active compliance throughout the entire operation, enabling safe interaction even under fault conditions. By designing a multimodal human-robot interface (HRI) providing real-time visualization of relevant system information and supporting seamless transitions between automatic and manual control, we improve operator situation awareness and fault detection capabilities. A high-level supervisor (SV) coordinates the execution and manages transitions between control modes, ensuring consistency with the supervisory control (SVC) paradigm, while preserving the human operator's authority.

For this reason, episodic test-time adaptation strategies have recently emerged as powerful techniques for adapting VLMs to a single unlabeled image. However, existing adaptation strategies, such as test-time prompt tuning, typically require backpropagating through large encoder weights or altering core model components. In this work, we introduce Spectrum-Aware Test-Time Steering (STS), a lightweight adaptation framework that extracts a spectral subspace from the textual embeddings to define principal semantic directions and learns to steer latent representations in a spectrum-aware manner by adapting a small number of per-sample shift parameters to minimize entropy across augmented views. STS operates entirely at inference in the latent space, without backpropagation through or modification of the frozen encoders. Building on standard evaluation protocols, our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that STS largely surpasses or compares favorably against state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods, while introducing only a handful of additional parameters and achieving inference speeds up to 8x faster with a 12x smaller memory footprint than conventional test-time prompt tuning.

These properties make origami increasingly valuable in robotic and deployable systems. However, accurately simulating their folding behavior and interactions with the environment remains challenging. To address this, we present a design framework for origami mechanism simulation that utilizes MuJoCo's deformable-body capabilities. In our approach, origami sheets are represented as graphs of interconnected deformable elements with user-specified constraints such as creases and actuation, defined through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). This framework allows users to generate physically consistent simulations that capture both the geometric structure of origami mechanisms and their interactions with external objects and surfaces. We demonstrate our method's utility through a case study on an origami catapult, where design parameters are optimized in simulation using the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) and validated experimentally on physical prototypes.

Animating Human Avatars in Diverse Scenes with Gaussian Splatting", "comment": null, "summary": "We present a novel framework for animating humans in 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a neural scene representation that has recently achieved state-of-the-art photorealistic results for novel-view synthesis but remains under-explored for human-scene animation and interaction. Unlike existing animation pipelines that use meshes or point clouds as the underlying 3D representation, our approach introduces the use of 3DGS as the 3D representation to the problem of animating humans in scenes. By representing humans and scenes as Gaussians, our approach allows for geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of humans interacting with 3D scenes. Our key insight is that the rendering can be decoupled from the motion synthesis and each sub-problem can be addressed independently, without the need for paired human-scene data. Central to our method is a Gaussian-aligned motion module that synthesizes motion without explicit scene geometry, using opacity-based cues and projected Gaussian structures to guide human placement and pose alignment. To ensure natural interactions, we further propose a human-scene Gaussian refinement optimization that enforces realistic contact and navigation. We evaluate our approach on scenes from Scannet++ and the SuperSplat library, and on avatars reconstructed from sparse and dense multi-view human capture. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework allows for novel applications such as geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of edited monocular RGB videos with new animated humans, showcasing the unique advantage of 3DGS for monocular video-based human animation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u75283D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff083DGS\uff09\u57283D\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u5236\u4f5c\u52a8\u753b\u30023DGS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6700\u8fd1\u5728\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7167\u7247\u7ea7\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b-\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u753b\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u5c1a\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c063DGS\u4f5c\u4e3a3D\u8868\u793a\u5f15\u5165\u5230\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u5236\u4f5c\u52a8\u753b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e3D\u573a\u666f\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u89c6\u70b9\u6e32\u67d3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u52a8\u753b\u6d41\u7a0b\u4f7f\u7528\u7f51\u683c\u6216\u70b9\u4e91\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e95\u5c42\u76843D\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b-\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u753b\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u5c1a\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f15\u51653DGS\u4f5c\u4e3a3D\u8868\u793a\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u5c06\u6e32\u67d3\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5408\u6210\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u72ec\u7acb\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u59ff\u52bf\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5408\u6210\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4eba\u7c7b-\u573a\u666f\u9ad8\u65af\u7ec6\u5316\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u903c\u771f\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u548c\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u5728Scannet++\u548cSuperSplat\u5e93\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4eba\u7c7b\u6355\u83b7\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u5316\u8eab\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b0\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u65b0\u52a8\u753b\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u5355\u76eeRGB\u89c6\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u89c6\u70b9\u6e32\u67d3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u75283DGS\u57283D\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u5236\u4f5c\u52a8\u753b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u89c6\u70b9\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u753b\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing methods often fail to jointly capture agents' long-term goals and their fine-grained social interactions, which leads to unrealistic multi-agent futures. We propose VISTA, a recursive goal-conditioned transformer for multi-agent trajectory forecasting. VISTA combines (i) a cross-attention fusion module that integrates long-horizon intent with past motion, (ii) a social-token attention mechanism for flexible interaction modeling across agents, and (iii) pairwise attention maps that make social influence patterns interpretable at inference time. Our model turns single-agent goal-conditioned prediction into a coherent multi-agent forecasting framework. Beyond standard displacement metrics, we evaluate trajectory collision rates as a measure of joint realism. On the high-density MADRAS benchmark and on SDD, VISTA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and substantially fewer collisions. On MADRAS, it reduces the average collision rate of strong baselines from 2.14 to 0.03 percent, and on SDD it attains zero collisions while improving ADE, FDE, and minFDE. These results show that VISTA generates socially compliant, goal-aware, and interpretable trajectories, making it promising for safety-critical autonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "VISTA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u3001\u4ee5\u76ee\u6807\u4e3a\u5bfc\u5411\u7684Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u957f\u671f\u610f\u56fe\u3001\u8fc7\u53bb\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u793e\u4ea4\u4ee3\u5e01\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u6210\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u672a\u6765\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u78b0\u649e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u957f\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u672a\u6765\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aVISTA\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u3001\u4ee5\u76ee\u6807\u4e3a\u5bfc\u5411\u7684Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6574\u5408\u957f\u671f\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u8fc7\u53bb\u8fd0\u52a8\uff1b\u4e00\u4e2a\u793e\u4ea4\u4ee3\u5e01\u6ce8\u610f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u7075\u6d3b\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca\u6210\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u89e3\u91ca\u793e\u4ea4\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728MADRAS\u548cSDD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cVISTA\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u78b0\u649e\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6210\u679c\u3002\u5b83\u5c06MADRAS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u4ece2.14%\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u81f30.03%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728SDD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u96f6\u78b0\u649e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86ADE\u3001FDE\u548cminFDE\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "VISTA\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u793e\u4ea4\u89c4\u8303\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u660e\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Real-world deployment requires open vocabulary generalization and low training overhead, motivating zero-shot methods rather than task-specific RL training. However, existing zero-shot methods that build explicit 3D scene graphs often compress rich visual observations into text-only relations, leading to high construction cost, irreversible loss of visual evidence, and constrained vocabularies. To address these limitations, we introduce the Multi-modal 3D Scene Graph (M3DSG), which preserves visual cues by replacing textual relational edges with dynamically assigned images. Built on M3DSG, we propose MSGNav, a zero-shot navigation system that includes a Key Subgraph Selection module for efficient reasoning, an Adaptive Vocabulary Update module for open vocabulary support, and a Closed-Loop Reasoning module for accurate exploration reasoning. Additionally, we further identify the last-mile problem in zero-shot navigation - determining the feasible target location with a suitable final viewpoint, and propose a Visibility-based Viewpoint Decision module to explicitly resolve it.

In this paper, we propose SemanticVLA, a novel VLA framework that performs Semantic-Aligned Sparsification and Enhancement for Efficient Robotic Manipulation. Specifically: 1) To sparsify redundant perception while preserving semantic alignment, Semantic-guided Dual Visual Pruner (SD-Pruner) performs: Instruction-driven Pruner (ID-Pruner) extracts global action cues and local semantic anchors in SigLIP; Spatial-aggregation Pruner (SA-Pruner) compacts geometry-rich features into task-adaptive tokens in DINOv2. 2) To exploit sparsified features and integrate semantics with spatial geometry, Semantic-complementary Hierarchical Fuser (SH-Fuser) fuses dense patches and sparse tokens across SigLIP and DINOv2 for coherent representation. 3) To enhance the transformation from perception to action, Semantic-conditioned Action Coupler (SA-Coupler) replaces the conventional observation-to-DoF approach, yielding more efficient and interpretable behavior modeling for manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on simulation and real-world tasks show that SemanticVLA sets a new SOTA in both performance and efficiency. SemanticVLA surpasses OpenVLA on LIBERO benchmark by 21.1% in success rate, while reducing training cost and inference latency by 3.0-fold and 2.7-fold.SemanticVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/SemanticVLA", "AI": {"tldr": "SemanticVLA\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u89c6\u89c9\u4fee\u526a\u5668\uff08SD-Pruner\uff09\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e92\u8865\u5206\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u5668\uff08SH-Fuser\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u611f\u77e5\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u6307\u4ee4-\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\u80a4\u6d45\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u6761\u4ef6\u52a8\u4f5c\u8026\u5408\u5668\uff08SA-Coupler\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u5230\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6210\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684Vision-Language-Action\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u5230\u611f\u77e5\u5197\u4f59\uff08\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff09\u548c\u80a4\u6d45\u6307\u4ee4-\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08\u963b\u788d\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\uff09\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSemanticVLA\u7684\u65b0\u578bVLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4fee\u526a\u5668\uff08ID-Pruner\uff09\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u5408\u4fee\u526a\u5668\uff08SA-Pruner\uff09\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u89c6\u89c9\u4fee\u526a\uff08SD-Pruner\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53bb\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u611f\u77e5\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u30022\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u4e92\u8865\u5206\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u5668\uff08SH-Fuser\uff09\u878d\u5408\u6765\u81eaSigLIP\u548cDINOv2\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u6591\u5757\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u30023\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u6761\u4ef6\u52a8\u4f5c\u8026\u5408\u5668\uff08SA-Coupler\uff09\u53d6\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff08DoF\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u4ece\u611f\u77e5\u5230\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eSemanticVLA\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684SOTA\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u5728LIBERO\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSemanticVLA\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6bd4OpenVLA\u9ad8\u51fa21.1%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e\u4e863.0\u500d\u548c2.7\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "SemanticVLA\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u521b\u65b0\u7684SD-Pruner\u3001SH-Fuser\u548cSA-Coupler\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u6548\u7387\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, they still face critical challenges in modeling long-range dependencies under the usage of Rotary Positional Encoding (ROPE). Although it can facilitate precise modeling of token positions, it induces progressive attention decay as token distance increases, especially with progressive attention decay over distant token pairs, which severely impairs the model's ability to remember global context. To alleviate this issue, we propose inference-only Three-step Decay Resilience Strategies (T-DRS), comprising (1) Semantic-Driven DRS (SD-DRS), amplifying semantically meaningful but distant signals via content-aware residuals, (2) Distance-aware Control DRS (DC-DRS), which can purify attention by smoothly modulating weights based on positional distances, suppressing noise while preserving locality, and (3) re-Reinforce Distant DRS (reRD-DRS), consolidating the remaining informative remote dependencies to maintain global coherence. Together, the T-DRS recover suppressed long-range token pairs without harming local inductive biases.

Some researchers have attempted to directly apply the foundation model to the RGB-D video salient object detection (RGB-D VSOD) task, which often encounters three challenges, including the dependence on manual prompts, the high memory consumption of sequential adapters, and the computational burden of memory attention. To address the limitations, we propose a novel method, namely Segment Anything Model with Depth-guided Adaptive Queries (SAM-DAQ), which adapts SAM2 to pop-out salient objects from videos by seamlessly integrating depth and temporal cues within a unified framework. Firstly, we deploy a parallel adapter-based multi-modal image encoder (PAMIE), which incorporates several depth-guided parallel adapters (DPAs) in a skip-connection way. Remarkably, we fine-tune the frozen SAM encoder under prompt-free conditions, where the DPA utilizes depth cues to facilitate the fusion of multi-modal features. Secondly, we deploy a query-driven temporal memory (QTM) module, which unifies the memory bank and prompt embeddings into a learnable pipeline. Concretely, by leveraging both frame-level queries and video-level queries simultaneously, the QTM module can not only selectively extract temporal consistency features but also iteratively update the temporal representations of the queries.

Current 3D-VLMs directly embed the 3D point clouds into 3D tokens, following large 2D-VLMs with powerful reasoning capabilities. However, this framework has a great computational cost limiting its application, where we identify that the bottleneck lies in processing all 3D tokens in the Large Language Model (LLM) part. This raises the question: how can we reduce the computational overhead introduced by 3D tokens while preserving the integrity of their essential information? To address this question, we introduce Hierarchical Compensatory Compression (HCC-3D) to efficiently compress 3D tokens while maintaining critical detail retention. Specifically, we first propose a global structure compression (GSC), in which we design global queries to compress all 3D tokens into a few key tokens while keeping overall structural information. Then, to compensate for the information loss in GSC, we further propose an adaptive detail mining (ADM) module that selectively recompresses salient but under-attended features through complementary scoring.

One key reason is that tiny objects carry limited features that are inevitably degraded or lost during long-distance network propagation. Another is that smaller objects receive disproportionately greater regression penalties than larger ones during training. To tackle these issues, we propose a Scale-Aware Relay Layer (SARL) and a Scale-Adaptive Loss (SAL) for tiny object detection, both of which are seamlessly compatible with the top-performing frameworks. Specifically, SARL employs a cross-scale spatial-channel attention to progressively enrich the meaningful features of each layer and strengthen the cross-layer feature sharing. SAL reshapes the vanilla IoU-based losses so as to dynamically assign lower weights to larger objects. This loss is able to focus training on tiny objects while reducing the influence on large objects. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmarks (\\textit{i.e.,} AI-TOD, DOTA-v2.0 and VisDrone2019), and the results demonstrate that the proposed method boosts the generalization ability by 5.5\\% Average Precision (AP) when embedded in YOLOv5 (anchor-based) and YOLOx (anchor-free) baselines.

Consequently, they fail to evaluate model performance for Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU), a critical challenge involving complex layouts and dense text. To address this, we introduce DocWeaver, a novel multi-agent pipeline that leverages Large Language Models to automatically generate a new benchmark. The result is MosaicDoc, a large-scale, bilingual (Chinese and English) resource designed to push the boundaries of VRDU.

However, this approach is susceptible to distribution drift, caused by the sequential optimization of shared backbone parameters. This results in a mismatch between the distributions of the previously learned classes and that of the updater model, ultimately degrading the effectiveness of classifier performance over time. To address this issue, we introduce a latent space transition operator and propose Sequential Learning with Drift Compensation (SLDC). SLDC aims to align feature distributions across tasks to mitigate the impact of drift. First, we present a linear variant of SLDC, which learns a linear operator by solving a regularized least-squares problem that maps features before and after fine-tuning. Next, we extend this with a weakly nonlinear SLDC variant, which assumes that the ideal transition operator lies between purely linear and fully nonlinear transformations. This is implemented using learnable, weakly nonlinear mappings that balance flexibility and generalization. To further reduce representation drift, we apply knowledge distillation (KD) in both algorithmic variants. Extensive experiments on standard CIL benchmarks demonstrate that SLDC significantly improves the performance of SeqFT. Notably, by combining KD to address representation drift with SLDC to compensate distribution drift, SeqFT achieves performance comparable to joint training across all evaluated datasets.

However, advanced deep learning-based ReID models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations to pedestrian images can cause entirely incorrect predictions, posing significant security threats. Although numerous adversarial defense strategies have been proposed for classification tasks, their extension to metric learning tasks such as person ReID remains relatively unexplored. Moreover, the several existing defenses for person ReID fail to address the inherent unique challenges of adversarially robust ReID. In this paper, we systematically identify the challenges of adversarial defense in person ReID into two key issues: model bias and composite generalization requirements. To address them, we propose a debiased dual-invariant defense framework composed of two main phases. In the data balancing phase, we mitigate model bias using a diffusion-model-based data resampling strategy that promotes fairness and diversity in training data. In the bi-adversarial self-meta defense phase, we introduce a novel metric adversarial training approach incorporating farthest negative extension softening to overcome the robustness degradation caused by the absence of classifier. Additionally, we introduce an adversarially-enhanced self-meta mechanism to achieve dual-generalization for both unseen identities and unseen attack types.

However, their detection latency and tendency to hallucinate predictions render them unsuitable for direct deployment. This work introduces a novel pipeline that addresses this challenge by leveraging VLMs to automatically generate pseudo-labels for training efficient, real-time object detectors. Our key innovation is a per-object co-teaching-based training strategy that mitigates the inherent noise in VLM-generated labels. The proposed per-object coteaching approach filters noisy bounding boxes from training instead of filtering the entire image. Specifically, two YOLO models learn collaboratively, filtering out unreliable boxes from each mini-batch based on their peers' per-object loss values. Overall, our pipeline provides an efficient, robust, and scalable approach to train high-performance object detectors for autonomous driving, significantly reducing reliance on costly human annotation. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms a baseline YOLOv5m model, achieving a significant mAP@0.5 boost ($31.12\\%$ to $46.61\\%$) while maintaining real-time detection latency. Furthermore, we show that supplementing our pseudo-labelled data with a small fraction of ground truth labels ($10\\%$) leads to further performance gains, reaching $57.97\\%$ mAP@0.5 on the KITTI dataset.

This paper aims to robustly fine-tune these vision-language models on in-distribution (ID) data without compromising their generalization abilities in out-of-distribution (OOD) and zero-shot settings. Current robust fine-tuning methods tackle this challenge by reusing contrastive learning, which was used in pre-training, for fine-tuning. However, we found that these methods distort the geometric structure of the embeddings, which plays a crucial role in the generalization of vision-language models, resulting in limited OOD and zero-shot performance. To address this, we propose Difference Vector Equalization (DiVE), which preserves the geometric structure during fine-tuning. The idea behind DiVE is to constrain difference vectors, each of which is obtained by subtracting the embeddings extracted from the pre-trained and fine-tuning models for the same data sample. By constraining the difference vectors to be equal across various data samples, we effectively preserve the geometric structure. Therefore, we introduce two losses: average vector loss (AVL) and pairwise vector loss (PVL). AVL preserves the geometric structure globally by constraining difference vectors to be equal to their weighted average. PVL preserves the geometric structure locally by ensuring a consistent multimodal alignment.

While recent diffusion-based approaches have shown improvements in visual quality, key limitations remain: lack of support for low-resource languages, domain gap between synthetic and real data, and the absence of appropriate metrics for evaluating text style preservation. To address these challenges, we propose STELLAR (Scene Text Editor for Low-resource LAnguages and Real-world data). STELLAR enables reliable multilingual editing through a language-adaptive glyph encoder and a multi-stage training strategy that first pre-trains on synthetic data and then fine-tunes on real images.

However, these systems remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that embed hidden malicious behaviors during training. A key limitation of existing backdoor attacks is their lack of physical realizability, primarily due to the digital-to-physical domain gap. Digital triggers often fail in real-world settings because they overlook material-dependent LiDAR reflection properties. On the other hand, physically constructed triggers are often unoptimized, leading to low effectiveness or easy detectability.This paper introduces Material-Oriented Backdoor Attack (MOBA), a novel framework that bridges the digital-physical gap by explicitly modeling the material properties of real-world triggers. MOBA tackles two key challenges in physical backdoor design: 1) robustness of the trigger material under diverse environmental conditions, 2) alignment between the physical trigger's behavior and its digital simulation. First, we propose a systematic approach to selecting robust trigger materials, identifying titanium dioxide (TiO_2) for its high diffuse reflectivity and environmental resilience. Second, to ensure the digital trigger accurately mimics the physical behavior of the material-based trigger, we develop a novel simulation pipeline that features: (1) an angle-independent approximation of the Oren-Nayar BRDF model to generate realistic LiDAR intensities, and (2) a distance-aware scaling mechanism to maintain spatial consistency across varying depths. We conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LiDAR-based and Camera-LiDAR fusion models, showing that MOBA achieves a 93.50% attack success rate, outperforming prior methods by over 41%.

Quantization algorithms compress Vision Transformers (ViTs) into low-bit formats, reducing memory and computation demands with minimal accuracy degradation. However, existing methods rely on uniform precision, ignoring the diverse sensitivity of ViT components to quantization. Metric-based Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) is a promising alternative, but previous MPQ methods for ViTs suffer from three major limitations: 1) coarse granularity, 2) mismatch in metric scale across component types, and 3) quantization-unaware bit allocation. In this paper, we propose LampQ (Layer-wise Mixed Precision Quantization for Vision Transformers), an accurate metric-based MPQ method for ViTs to overcome these limitations. LampQ performs layer-wise quantization to achieve both fine-grained control and efficient acceleration, incorporating a type-aware Fisher-based metric to measure sensitivity. Then, LampQ assigns bit-widths optimally through integer linear programming and further updates them iteratively.

Existing approaches often operate at the object level or disjointedly handle fine-grained affordance reasoning, lacking coherent, instruction-driven grounding and reasoning. In this work, we introduce a new task: Fine-grained 3D Embodied Reasoning, which requires an agent to predict, for each referenced affordance element in a 3D scene, a structured triplet comprising its spatial location, motion type, and motion axis, based on a task instruction. To solve this task, we propose AffordBot, a novel framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with a tailored chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paradigm. To bridge the gap between 3D input and 2D-compatible MLLMs, we render surround-view images of the scene and project 3D element candidates into these views, forming a rich visual representation aligned with the scene geometry. Our CoT pipeline begins with an active perception stage, prompting the MLLM to select the most informative viewpoint based on the instruction, before proceeding with step-by-step reasoning to localize affordance elements and infer plausible interaction motions.

However, visible and infrared modalities captured by different sensors exist the information imbalance problem in complex scenarios, which can cause inadequate cross-modal fusion, resulting in degraded detection performance. \\textcolor{red}{Furthermore, most existing methods use transformers in the spatial domain to capture complementary features, ignoring the advantages of developing frequency domain transformers to mine complementary information.} To solve these weaknesses, we propose a frequency domain fusion transformer, called FreDFT, for visible-infrared object detection. The proposed approach employs a novel multimodal frequency domain attention (MFDA) to mine complementary information between modalities and a frequency domain feed-forward layer (FDFFL) via a mixed-scale frequency feature fusion strategy is designed to better enhance multimodal features. To eliminate the imbalance of multimodal information, a cross-modal global modeling module (CGMM) is constructed to perform pixel-wise inter-modal feature interaction in a spatial and channel manner.

However, the study of image screening is rare and its performance with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is unsatisfactory due to the lack of data and the weak image aesthetic reasoning ability in MLLMs. In this work, we propose a complete solution to address these problems in terms of data and methodology. For data, we collect a comprehensive image screening dataset with over 128k samples, about 640k images. Each sample consists of an original image, four generated images. The dataset evaluates the image aesthetic reasoning ability under four aspects: appearance deformation, physical shadow, placement layout, and extension rationality. Regarding data annotation, we investigate multiple approaches, including purely manual, fully automated, and answer-driven annotations, to acquire high-quality chains of thought (CoT) data in the most cost-effective manner. Methodologically, we introduce a Hard Cases Mining (HCM) strategy with a Dynamic Proportional Accuracy (DPA) reward into the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, called HCM-GRPO. This enhanced method demonstrates superior image aesthetic reasoning capabilities compared to the original GRPO. Our experimental results reveal that even state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs, such as GPT4o and Qwen-VL-Max, exhibit performance akin to random guessing in image aesthetic reasoning. In contrast, by leveraging the HCM-GRPO, we are able to surpass the scores of both large-scale open-source and leading closed-source models with a much smaller model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7b5b\u9009\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6536\u96c6\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc7128k\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u3001\u7ea6640k\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5927\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHCM-GRPO\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5ba1\u7f8e\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u5f31\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u867d\u6709\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7b5b\u9009\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u53caMLLMs\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5ba1\u7f8e\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1. \u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b128k+\u6837\u672c\u3001640k+\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5916\u89c2\u53d8\u5f62\u3001\u7269\u7406\u9634\u5f71\u3001\u5e03\u5c40\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u5408\u7406\u6027\u56db\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u624b\u52a8\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u7b54\u6848\u9a71\u52a8\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u6570\u636e\u30022. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHCM-GRPO\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u786c\u6848\u4f8b\u6316\u6398\uff08HCM\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08DPA\uff09\u5956\u52b1\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eGroup Relative Policy Optimization\uff08GRPO\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5ba1\u7f8e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u50cfGPT4o\u548cQwen-VL-Max\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u9876\u5c16\u95ed\u6e90MLLMs\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5ba1\u7f8e\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e5f\u63a5\u8fd1\u968f\u673a\u731c\u6d4b\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528HCM-GRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c4\u6a21\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5c31\u80fd\u591f\u8d85\u8d8a\u5927\u578b\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9886\u5148\u7684\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u50cf\u7b5b\u9009\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHCM-GRPO\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5ba1\u7f8e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u89e3\u51b3MLLMs\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7b5b\u9009\u65b9\u9762\u6311\u6218\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

To study this, we introduce a new benchmark, AV-ConfuseBench, which simulates an ``Audio-Visual Confusion'' scene by modifying the corresponding sound of an object in the video, e.g., mute the sounding object and ask MLLMs Is there a/an muted-object sound''. Experimental results reveal that MLLMs, such as Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemini 2.5, struggle to discriminate non-existent audio due to visually dominated reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we introduce RL-CoMM, a Reinforcement Learning-based Collaborative Multi-MLLM that is built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni foundation. RL-CoMM includes two stages: 1) To alleviate visually dominated ambiguities, we introduce an external model, a Large Audio Language Model (LALM), as the reference model to generate audio-only reasoning. Then, we design a Step-wise Reasoning Reward function that enables MLLMs to self-improve audio-visual reasoning with the audio-only reference. 2) To ensure an accurate answer prediction, we introduce Answer-centered Confidence Optimization to reduce the uncertainty of potential heterogeneous reasoning differences.

To support development and evaluation, we introduce CPREval-6k, a multi-view, multi-label medical action benchmark containing 6,372 expert-annotated videos with 22 clinical labels. Using this dataset, we present GaussMedAct, a multivariate Gaussian encoding framework, to advance medical motion analysis through adaptive spatiotemporal representation learning. Multivariate Gaussian Representation projects the joint motions to a temporally scaled multi-dimensional space, and decomposes actions into adaptive 3D Gaussians that serve as tokens. These tokens preserve motion semantics through anisotropic covariance modeling while maintaining robustness to spatiotemporal noise. Hybrid Spatial Encoding, employing a Cartesian and Vector dual-stream strategy, effectively utilizes skeletal information in the form of joint and bone features. The proposed method achieves 92.1% Top-1 accuracy with real-time inference on the benchmark, outperforming the ST-GCN baseline by +5.9% accuracy with only 10% FLOPs.

This leads to confirmation bias, especially under sparse annotations or class imbalance, where models overfit confident errors and fail to generalize. We propose CABIN (Cognitive-Aware Behavior-Informed learNing), a semi-supervised framework that addresses this limitation through a closed-loop learning process of perception, action, and correction. CABIN first develops perceptual awareness by estimating epistemic uncertainty, identifying ambiguous regions where errors are likely to occur. It then acts by adopting an Uncertainty-Guided Dual Sampling Strategy, selecting uncertain samples for exploration while anchoring confident ones as stable pseudo-labels to reduce bias. To correct noisy supervision, CABIN introduces a Fine-Grained Dynamic Assignment Strategy that categorizes pseudo-labeled data into reliable, ambiguous, and noisy subsets, applying tailored losses to enhance generalization.

Unlike existing semantic communication techniques that process each modality separately, VLF-MSC employs a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to encode the source image into a vision-language semantic feature (VLF), which is transmitted over the wireless channel. At the receiver, a decoder-based language model and a diffusion-based image generator are both conditioned on the VLF to produce a descriptive text and a semantically aligned image.

Existing generative methods typically operate on local joint rotations, which are defined hierarchically based on the skeleton structure. This leads to cumulative errors during generation, manifesting as unstable and implausible motions at end-effectors. In this work, we propose GlobalDiff, a diffusion-based framework that operates directly in the space of global joint rotations for the first time, fundamentally decoupling each joint's prediction from upstream dependencies and alleviating hierarchical error accumulation. To compensate for the absence of structural priors in global rotation space, we introduce a multi-level constraint scheme. Specifically, a joint structure constraint introduces virtual anchor points around each joint to better capture fine-grained orientation. A skeleton structure constraint enforces angular consistency across bones to maintain structural integrity. A temporal structure constraint utilizes a multi-scale variational encoder to align the generated motion with ground-truth temporal patterns. These constraints jointly regularize the global diffusion process and reinforce structural awareness. Extensive evaluations on standard co-speech benchmarks show that GlobalDiff generates smooth and accurate motions, improving the performance by 46.0 % compared to the current SOTA under multiple speaker identities.", "AI": {"tldr": "GlobalDiff\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b83\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u5173\u8282\u65cb\u8f6c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u8bef\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u5173\u8282\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7d2f\u79ef\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u5173\u8282\u65cb\u8f6c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff08GlobalDiff\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u5173\u8282\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u9aa8\u9abc\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\u6765\u5f25\u8865\u5168\u5c40\u65cb\u8f6c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u3002", "result": "GlobalDiff\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8646.0%\u3002", "conclusion": "GlobalDiff\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u65cb\u8f6c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u9a71\u52a8\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, the large number of visual tokens introduces significant computational overhead. To address this issue, visual token pruning has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the efficiency of MLLMs. In cognitive science, humans tend to first determine which regions of a scene to attend to (\"where to look\") before deciding which specific elements within those regions to process in detail (\"what to select\"). This two-stage strategy enables the visual system to efficiently allocate attention at a coarse spatial level before performing fine-grained selection. However, existing pruning methods primarily focus on directly optimizing \"what to select\", typically using attention scores or similarity metrics. They rarely consider \"where to look\", which has been shown to lead to inefficient spatial allocation, positional bias, and the retention of irrelevant or redundant tokens. In this paper, we propose GridPrune, a method that replaces the global Top-K mechanism with a \"guide-globally, select-locally\" zonal selection system. GridPrune splits the pruning process into two steps: first, it uses text-conditional guidance to dynamically allocate a token budget across spatial zones; and then, it performs local selection within each budgeted zone. Experimental results demonstrate that GridPrune achieves superior performance across various MLLM architectures.

In this paper, we explore the combination of LLMs with the human skeleton to perform action classification and description. However, when treating LLM as a recognizer, two questions arise: 1) How can LLMs understand skeleton? 2) How can LLMs distinguish among actions? To address these problems, we introduce a novel paradigm named learning Skeleton representation with visUal-motion knowledGe for Action Recognition (SUGAR). In our pipeline, we first utilize off-the-shelf large-scale video models as a knowledge base to generate visual, motion information related to actions. Then, we propose to supervise skeleton learning through this prior knowledge to yield discrete representations. Finally, we use the LLM with untouched pre-training weights to understand these representations and generate the desired action targets and descriptions.

In this paper, we propose RobIA, a novel Robust, Instance-Aware framework for Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) in stereo depth estimation. RobIA integrates two key components: (1) Attend-and-Excite Mixture-of-Experts (AttEx-MoE), a parameter-efficient module that dynamically routes input to frozen experts via lightweight self-attention mechanism tailored to epipolar geometry, and (2) Robust AdaptBN Teacher, a PEFT-based teacher model that provides dense pseudo-supervision by complementing sparse handcrafted labels. This strategy enables input-specific flexibility, broad supervision coverage, improving generalization under domain shift.

Recent methods primarily focus on leveraging additional prior knowledge and advanced multi-task architectures to achieve competitive performance. However, these pipelines rely on implicit modeling that uses frame-level or fragmented video features, failing to capture the temporal coherence across event sequences and comprehensive semantics within visual contexts. To address this, we propose an explicit temporal-semantic modeling framework called Context-Aware Cross-Modal Interaction (CACMI), which leverages both latent temporal characteristics within videos and linguistic semantics from text corpus. Specifically, our model consists of two core components: Cross-modal Frame Aggregation aggregates relevant frames to extract temporally coherent, event-aligned textual features through cross-modal retrieval; and Context-aware Feature Enhancement utilizes query-guided attention to integrate visual dynamics with pseudo-event semantics.

This survey investigates this breakdown across three core primitives-negation, counting, and spatial relations. Our analysis reveals a dramatic performance collapse: models that are accurate on single primitives fail precipitously when these are combined, exposing severe interference. We trace this failure to three key factors. First, training data show a near-total absence of explicit negations. Second, continuous attention architectures are fundamentally unsuitable for discrete logic. Third, evaluation metrics reward visual plausibility over constraint satisfaction. By analyzing recent benchmarks and methods, we show that current solutions and simple scaling cannot bridge this gap.

However, the representational capacity of INR defined by the range of functions the neural network can characterize, is inherently limited by the low-dimensional feature space in conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures. While widening the MLP can linearly increase feature space dimensionality, it also leads to a quadratic growth in computational and memory costs. To address this limitation, we propose the split-layer, a novel reformulation of MLP construction. The split-layer divides each layer into multiple parallel branches and integrates their outputs via Hadamard product, effectively constructing a high-degree polynomial space. This approach significantly enhances INR's representational capacity by expanding the feature space dimensionality without incurring prohibitive computational overhead.

Although many TIPR methods have achieved promising results, sometimes textual queries cannot accurately and comprehensively reflect the content of the image, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and overfitting to limited datasets. Moreover, the inherent modality gap between text and image further amplifies these issues, making accurate cross-modal retrieval even more challenging. To address these limitations, we propose the Generation-Enhanced Alignment (GEA) from a generative perspective. GEA contains two parallel modules: (1) Text-Guided Token Enhancement (TGTE), which introduces diffusion-generated images as intermediate semantic representations to bridge the gap between text and visual patterns. These generated images enrich the semantic representation of text and facilitate cross-modal alignment.

However, as more agents participate, existing frameworks face two key challenges: (1) the participating agents are inherently multi-modal and heterogeneous, and (2) the collaborative framework must be scalable to accommodate new agents. The former requires effective cross-agent feature alignment to mitigate heterogeneity loss, while the latter renders full-parameter training impractical, highlighting the importance of scalable adaptation. To address these issues, we propose Heterogeneous Adaptation (HeatV2X), a scalable collaborative framework. We first train a high-performance agent based on heterogeneous graph attention as the foundation for collaborative learning. Then, we design Local Heterogeneous Fine-Tuning and Global Collaborative Fine-Tuning to achieve effective alignment and interaction among heterogeneous agents. The former efficiently extracts modality-specific differences using Hetero-Aware Adapters, while the latter employs the Multi-Cognitive Adapter to enhance cross-agent collaboration and fully exploit the fusion potential. These designs enable substantial performance improvement of the collaborative framework with minimal training cost. We evaluate our approach on the OPV2V-H and DAIR-V2X datasets.

This is a challenging task since it involves complex vision-language understanding and spatiotemporal reasoning. Recent works have explored weakly-supervised setting in STVG to eliminate reliance on fine-grained annotations like bounding boxes or temporal stamps. However, they typically follow a simple late-fusion manner, which generates tubes independent of the text description, often resulting in failed target identification and inconsistent target tracking. To address this limitation, we propose a Tube-conditioned Reconstruction with Mutual Constraints (\\textbf{TubeRMC}) framework that generates text-conditioned candidate tubes with pre-trained visual grounding models and further refine them via tube-conditioned reconstruction with spatio-temporal constraints. Specifically, we design three reconstruction strategies from temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal perspectives to comprehensively capture rich tube-text correspondences. Each strategy is equipped with a Tube-conditioned Reconstructor, utilizing spatio-temporal tubes as condition to reconstruct the key clues in the query.

Existing AQA methods primarily predict scores based on features extracted from the entire video, resulting in limited interpretability and reliability. Meanwhile, existing AQA datasets also lack fine-grained annotations for action scores, especially for deduction items and sub-score annotations. In this paper, we construct the first AQA dataset containing fine-grained sub-score and deduction annotations for aerial skiing, which will be released as a new benchmark. For the technical challenges, we propose a novel AQA method, named JudgeMind, which significantly enhances performance and reliability by simulating the judgment and scoring mindset of professional referees. Our method segments the input action video into different stages and scores each stage to enhance accuracy. Then, we propose a stage-aware feature enhancement and fusion module to boost the perception of stage-specific key regions and enhance the robustness to visual changes caused by frequent camera viewpoints switching. In addition, we propose a knowledge-based grade-aware decoder to incorporate possible deduction items as prior knowledge to predict more accurate and reliable scores.

The task integrates three subtasks: emotion recognition, facial Action Unit (AU) recognition, and AU-based emotion reasoning to model affective states jointly. While recent approaches leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and achieve promising results, they face two critical limitations: (1) hallucinated reasoning, where VLMs generate plausible but inaccurate explanations due to insufficient emotion-specific knowledge; and (2) misalignment between emotion reasoning and recognition, caused by fragmented connections between observed facial features and final labels. We propose Facial-R1, a three-stage alignment framework that effectively addresses both challenges with minimal supervision. First, we employ instruction fine-tuning to establish basic emotional reasoning capability. Second, we introduce reinforcement training guided by emotion and AU labels as reward signals, which explicitly aligns the generated reasoning process with the predicted emotion.

Existing approaches typically rely on feature-selection mechanisms or region-proposal strategies to localize discriminative regions for semantic analysis. However, these methods often fail to capture discriminative cues comprehensively while introducing substantial category-agnostic redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose H3Former, a novel token-to-region framework that leverages high-order semantic relations to aggregate local fine-grained representations with structured region-level modeling. Specifically, we propose the Semantic-Aware Aggregation Module (SAAM), which exploits multi-scale contextual cues to dynamically construct a weighted hypergraph among tokens. By applying hypergraph convolution, SAAM captures high-order semantic dependencies and progressively aggregates token features into compact region-level representations. Furthermore, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Loss (HHCL), which enforces hierarchical semantic constraints in a non-Euclidean embedding space. The HHCL enhances inter-class separability and intra-class consistency while preserving the intrinsic hierarchical relationships among fine-grained categories. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four standard FGVC benchmarks validate the superiority of our H3Former framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "H3Former\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u9636\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u6765\u805a\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6355\u6349\u533a\u5206\u6027\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u5904\u7406\u7c7b\u522b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aH3Former\u7684\u65b0\u578btoken\u5230region\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u9636\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u6765\u805a\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff08SAAM\uff09\u548c\u53cc\u66f2\u7ebf\u5206\u5c42\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\uff08HHCL\uff09\u3002SAAM\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ebf\u7d22\u5728token\u4e4b\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u52a0\u6743\u8d85\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u6355\u83b7\u9ad8\u9636\u8bed\u4e49\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5c06token\u7279\u5f81\u9010\u6b65\u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u8868\u793a\u3002HHCL\u5728\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u4f55\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u5206\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7c7b\u95f4\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u6027\u548c\u7c7b\u5185\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7c7b\u522b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5206\u5c42\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u7684FGVC\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cH3Former\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e2d\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "H3Former\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u9ad8\u9636\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u533a\u57df\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6210\u679c\u3002"}}

Existing post-training paradigms are limited: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) relies on costly step-level annotations, while Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods like GRPO provide only sparse, outcome-level feedback, hindering stable optimization. We introduce PROPA (Process-level Reasoning Optimization with interleaved Policy Alignment), a novel framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with GRPO to generate dense, process-level rewards and optimize reasoning at each intermediate step without human annotations. To overcome the cold-start problem, PROPA interleaves GRPO updates with SFT, enabling the model to learn from both successful and failed reasoning trajectories. A Process Reward Model (PRM) is further trained to guide inference-time search, aligning the test-time search with the training signal. Across seven benchmarks and four VLM backbones, PROPA consistently outperforms both SFT- and RLVR-based baselines. It achieves up to 17.0% gains on in-domain tasks and 21.0% gains on out-of-domain tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art, establishing a strong reasoning and generalization capability for visual reasoning tasks.

Existing inference-time interventions to mitigate this issue present a challenging trade-off: while methods that steer internal states or adjust output logits can be effective, they often incur substantial computational overhead, typically requiring extra forward passes. This efficiency bottleneck can limit their practicality for real-world, latency-sensitive deployments. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off with Residual-Update Directed DEcoding Regulation (RUDDER), a low-overhead framework that steers LVLMs towards visually-grounded generation. RUDDER is built on two key innovations: (1) Contextual Activation Residual Direction (CARD) vector, a per-sample visual evidence vector extracted from the residual update of a self-attention layer during a single, standard forward pass. (2) A Bayesian-inspired adaptive gate that performs token-wise injection, applying a corrective signal whose strength is conditioned on the model's deviation from the visual context.

Code is available at https://github.com/lessiYin/DSANet", "summary": "Recent advancements in weakly-supervised video anomaly detection have achieved remarkable performance by applying the multiple instance learning paradigm based on multimodal foundation models such as CLIP to highlight anomalous instances and classify categories. However, their objectives may tend to detect the most salient response segments, while neglecting to mine diverse normal patterns separated from anomalies, and are prone to category confusion due to similar appearance, leading to unsatisfactory fine-grained classification results. Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Semantic Alignment Network (DSANet) to explicitly separate abnormal and normal features from coarse-grained and fine-grained aspects, enhancing the distinguishability. Specifically, at the coarse-grained level, we introduce a self-guided normality modeling branch that reconstructs input video features under the guidance of learned normal prototypes, encouraging the model to exploit normality cues inherent in the video, thereby improving the temporal separation of normal patterns and anomalous events. At the fine-grained level, we present a decoupled contrastive semantic alignment mechanism, which first temporally decomposes each video into event-centric and background-centric components using frame-level anomaly scores and then applies visual-language contrastive learning to enhance class-discriminative representations.

While recent methods like CLIP-based semantic augmentation have shown promise, they often overlook the underlying structure of feature distributions and frequency-domain characteristics that are critical for robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances SDG object detection by integrating the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution and Fourier transformation into a CLIP-guided pipeline. Specifically, we model the directional features of object representations using vMF to better capture domain-invariant semantic structures in the embedding space. Additionally, we introduce a Fourier-based augmentation strategy that perturbs amplitude and phase components to simulate domain shifts in the frequency domain, further improving feature robustness. Our method not only preserves the semantic alignment benefits of CLIP but also enriches feature diversity and structural consistency across domains.

We introduce SHRUG-FM, a framework for reliability-aware prediction that integrates three complementary signals: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in the input space, OOD detection in the embedding space and task-specific predictive uncertainty. Applied to burn scar segmentation, SHRUG-FM shows that OOD scores correlate with lower performance in specific environmental conditions, while uncertainty-based flags help discard many poorly performing predictions. Linking these flags to land cover attributes from HydroATLAS shows that failures are not random but concentrated in certain geographies, such as low-elevation zones and large river areas, likely due to underrepresentation in pretraining data. SHRUG-FM provides a pathway toward safer and more interpretable deployment of GFMs in climate-sensitive applications, helping bridge the gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "SHRUG-FM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5730\u7403\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08GFM\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ee5\u53ca\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b20\u4ee3\u8868\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5730\u7403\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684GFM\u5728\u6b20\u4ee3\u8868\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "SHRUG-FM\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1a\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u706b\u70e7\u75a4\u75d5\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSHRUG-FM\u8868\u660eOOD\u5206\u6570\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6807\u5fd7\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5254\u9664\u5927\u91cf\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6807\u5fd7\u4e0eHydroATLAS\u7684\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u5c5e\u6027\u5173\u8054\u540e\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u6548\u5e76\u975e\u968f\u673a\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u5730\u7406\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5982\u4f4e\u6d77\u62d4\u533a\u57df\u548c\u5927\u578b\u6cb3\u6d41\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u6240\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "SHRUG-FM\u4e3aGFM\u5728\u6c14\u5019\u654f\u611f\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f25\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Recent defense mechanisms like Anti-DreamBooth attempt to mitigate this risk by injecting adversarial perturbations into user photos to prevent successful personalization. However, we identify two critical yet overlooked limitations of these methods. First, the adversarial examples often exhibit perceptible artifacts such as conspicuous patterns or stripes, making them easily detectable as manipulated content. Second, the perturbations are highly fragile, as even a simple, non-learned filter can effectively remove them, thereby restoring the model's ability to memorize and reproduce user identity. To investigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel evaluation framework, AntiDB_Purify, to systematically evaluate existing defenses under realistic purification threats, including both traditional image filters and adversarial purification. Results reveal that none of the current methods maintains their protective effectiveness under such threats. These findings highlight that current defenses offer a false sense of security and underscore the urgent need for more imperceptible and robust protections to safeguard user identity in personalized generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e2a\u6027\u5316AI\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982DreamBooth\uff09\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5b9a\u5236\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5e26\u6765\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9762\u90e8\u8eab\u4efd\u6cc4\u9732\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5982Anti-DreamBooth\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u75d5\u8ff9\u548c\u6613\u88ab\u8f7b\u6613\u53bb\u9664\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u75d5\u8ff9\uff0c\u4e14\u6613\u88ab\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u6ee4\u6ce2\u6216\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u51c0\u5316\u53bb\u9664\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u51c0\u5316\u5a01\u80c1\u4e0b\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAntiDB_Purify\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u51c0\u5316\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u51c0\u5316\u5a01\u80c1\u65f6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u4e0a\u8ff0\u51c0\u5316\u5a01\u80c1\u65f6\uff0c\u90fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u4fdd\u62a4\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u865a\u5047\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u611f\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd\u6765\u4fdd\u969c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u7528\u6237\u8eab\u4efd\u5b89\u5168\u3002"}}

However, real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images or formulas, and cross-page structures, which remain challenging for existing OCR systems. We introduce MonkeyOCR v1.5, a unified vision-language framework that enhances both layout understanding and content recognition through a two-stage parsing pipeline. The first stage employs a large multimodal model to jointly predict document layout and reading order, leveraging visual information to ensure structural and sequential consistency. The second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions, maintaining high visual fidelity while reducing error propagation. To address complex table structures, we propose a visual consistency-based reinforcement learning scheme that evaluates recognition quality via render-and-compare alignment, improving structural accuracy without manual annotations. Additionally, two specialized modules, Image-Decoupled Table Parsing and Type-Guided Table Merging, are introduced to enable reliable parsing of tables containing embedded images and reconstruction of tables crossing pages or columns.

However, existing fault detection methods are largely limited to visual recognition, producing structured outputs that lack semantic interpretability and fail to support maintenance decision-making. To address these limitations, this study proposes an integrated framework that combines YOLOMS with a large language model (LLM) for intelligent fault analysis and diagnosis. Specifically, YOLOMS employs multi-scale detection and sliding-window cropping to enhance fault feature extraction, while a lightweight key-value (KV) mapping module bridges the gap between visual outputs and textual inputs. This module converts YOLOMS detection results into structured textual representations enriched with both qualitative and quantitative attributes. A domain-tuned LLM then performs semantic reasoning to generate interpretable fault analyses and maintenance recommendations.

Early detection is crucial as it can alter pancreas function through morphological changes and increased deposition of ectopic fat, eventually leading to organ damage. While studies have shown an association between T2DM and pancreas volume and fat content, the role of increased pancreatic surface lobularity (PSL) in patients with T2DM has not been fully investigated. In this pilot work, we propose a fully automated approach to delineate the pancreas and other abdominal structures, derive CT imaging biomarkers, and opportunistically screen for T2DM. Four deep learning-based models were used to segment the pancreas in an internal dataset of 584 patients (297 males, 437 non-diabetic, age: 45$\\pm$15 years). PSL was automatically detected and it was higher for diabetic patients (p=0.01) at 4.26 $\\pm$ 8.32 compared to 3.19 $\\pm$ 3.62 for non-diabetic patients. The PancAP model achieved the highest Dice score of 0.79 $\\pm$ 0.17 and lowest ASSD error of 1.94 $\\pm$ 2.63 mm (p$<$0.05). For predicting T2DM, a multivariate model trained with CT biomarkers attained 0.90 AUC, 66.7\\% sensitivity, and 91.9\\% specificity.

In this study, we present a Learnable Total Variation (LTV) framework that couples an unrolled TV solver with a data-driven Lambda Mapping Network (LambdaNet) predicting a per-pixel regularization map. The pipeline is trained end-to-end so that reconstruction and regularization are optimized jointly, yielding spatially adaptive smoothing: strong in homogeneous regions, relaxed near anatomical boundaries. Experiments on the DeepLesion dataset, using a realistic noise model adapted from the LoDoPaB-CT methodology, show consistent gains over classical TV and FBP+U-Net: +2.9 dB PSNR and +6% SSIM on average. LTV provides an interpretable alternative to black-box CNNs and a basis for 3D and data-consistency-driven reconstruction.

Despite considerable progress in 4D neural rendering, existing approaches either model dynamic scenes holistically or model scenes and backgrounds separately aim to introduce parametric human priors.

To address this, we propose {\\bf Separate-then-Map} (StM) strategy that introduces a dedicated information mapping mechanism to bridge separately defined and optimized models. Our method employs a shared transformation function for each Gaussian attribute to unify separately modeled components, enhancing computational efficiency by avoiding exhaustive pairwise interactions while ensuring spatial and visual coherence between humans and their surroundings.

Existing generative approaches typically rely on lengthy textual prompts, reference images, or parameter-efficient fine-tuning to guide style-aware image generation, but often struggle with style consistency, limited creativity, and complex style representations. In this paper, we affirm that a style is worth one numerical code by introducing the novel task, code-to-style image generation, which produces images with novel, consistent visual styles conditioned solely on a numerical style code. To date, this field has only been primarily explored by the industry (e.g., Midjourney), with no open-source research from the academic community. To fill this gap, we propose CoTyle, the first open-source method for this task. Specifically, we first train a discrete style codebook from a collection of images to extract style embeddings. These embeddings serve as conditions for a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I-DM) to generate stylistic images. Subsequently, we train an autoregressive style generator on the discrete style embeddings to model their distribution, allowing the synthesis of novel style embeddings. During inference, a numerical style code is mapped to a unique style embedding by the style generator, and this embedding guides the T2I-DM to generate images in the corresponding style. Unlike existing methods, our method offers unparalleled simplicity and diversity, unlocking a vast space of reproducible styles from minimal input. Extensive experiments validate that CoTyle effectively turns a numerical code into a style controller, demonstrating a style is worth one code.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u201c\u4ee3\u7801\u5230\u98ce\u683c\u201d\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u503c\u98ce\u683c\u4ee3\u7801\u6765\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u89c6\u89c9\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u521b\u9020\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u98ce\u683c\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u521b\u9020\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u98ce\u683c\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u884c\u4e1a\uff08\u5982 Midjourney\uff09\u867d\u7136\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4f46\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f00\u653e\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a CoTyle \u7684\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u3001\u5f00\u6e90\u7684\u201c\u4ee3\u7801\u5230\u98ce\u683c\u201d\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u96c6\u5408\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u79bb\u6563\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08T2I-DM\uff09\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u6765\u751f\u6210\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u98ce\u683c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u5176\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5408\u6210\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\u3002\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u98ce\u683c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5c06\u6570\u503c\u98ce\u683c\u4ee3\u7801\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8be5\u5d4c\u5165\u6307\u5bfc T2I-DM \u751f\u6210\u76f8\u5e94\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "CoTyle \u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u6570\u503c\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u201c\u4ee3\u7801\u5373\u98ce\u683c\u201d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "conclusion": "CoTyle \u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u7684\u201c\u4ee3\u7801\u5230\u98ce\u683c\u201d\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u98ce\u683c\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this issue, we introduce OmniVGGT, a novel framework that can effectively benefit from an arbitrary number of auxiliary geometric modalities during both training and inference. In our framework, a GeoAdapter is proposed to encode depth and camera intrinsics/extrinsics into a spatial foundation model. It employs zero-initialized convolutions to progressively inject geometric information without disrupting the foundation model's representation space. This design ensures stable optimization with negligible overhead, maintaining inference speed comparable to VGGT even with multiple additional inputs. Additionally, a stochastic multimodal fusion regimen is proposed, which randomly samples modality subsets per instance during training. This enables an arbitrary number of modality inputs during testing and promotes learning robust spatial representations instead of overfitting to auxiliary cues. Comprehensive experiments on monocular/multi-view depth estimation, multi-view stereo, and camera pose estimation demonstrate that OmniVGGT outperforms prior methods with auxiliary inputs and achieves state-of-the-art results even with RGB-only input. To further highlight its practical utility, we integrated OmniVGGT into vision-language-action (VLA) models.

First, an object-based image analysis (OBIA) Mamba model (OBIA-Mamba) is designed to reduce redundant computation without compromising fine-grained details by using superpixels as Mamba tokens. Second, a global-local (GLocal) dual-branch convolutional neural network (CNN)-mamba architecture is designed to jointly model local spatial detail and global contextual information. Third, a multitask optimization framework is designed to employ dual loss functions to balance local precision with global consistency.

In pursuit of minimal modeling, DA3 yields two key insights: a single plain transformer (e.g., vanilla DINO encoder) is sufficient as a backbone without architectural specialization, and a singular depth-ray prediction target obviates the need for complex multi-task learning. Through our teacher-student training paradigm, the model achieves a level of detail and generalization on par with Depth Anything 2 (DA2). We establish a new visual geometry benchmark covering camera pose estimation, any-view geometry and visual rendering. On this benchmark, DA3 sets a new state-of-the-art across all tasks, surpassing prior SOTA VGGT by an average of 44.3% in camera pose accuracy and 25.1% in geometric accuracy. Moreover, it outperforms DA2 in monocular depth estimation.

In the multiple-choice setting - a dominant format for multimodal reasoning benchmarks - the paradigm faces a significant yet often overlooked obstacle: unfaithful trajectories that guess the correct option after a faulty chain of thought receive the same reward as genuine reasoning, which is a flaw that cannot be ignored. We propose Self-Consistency Sampling (SCS) to correct this issue. For each question, SCS (i) introduces small visual perturbations and (ii) performs repeated truncation and resampling of an initial trajectory; agreement among the resulting trajectories yields a differentiable consistency score that down-weights unreliable traces during policy updates. Based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, plugging SCS into RLOO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++ series improves accuracy by up to 7.7 percentage points on six multimodal benchmarks with negligible extra computation. SCS also yields notable gains on both Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct and InternVL3-8B, offering a simple, general remedy for outcome-reward RL in MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCS\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u4e2d\u56e0\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u800c\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u672a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff08\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u4f46\u731c\u4e2d\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\uff09\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u83b7\u5f97\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "SCS\u901a\u8fc7\uff08i\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u5c0f\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6270\u52a8\u548c\uff08ii\uff09\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u590d\u622a\u65ad\u548c\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8be5\u5206\u6570\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u671f\u95f4\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "SCS\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5728Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad87.7\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct\u548cInternVL3-8B\u4e0a\u4e5f\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "SCS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002"}}

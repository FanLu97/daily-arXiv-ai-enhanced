TL;DR: Ergodic control is adapted for robots with physical volume, improving coverage efficiency by over twofold while maintaining task completion.

Motivation: Existing ergodic control models robots as points, ignoring their physical volume and sensor interactions, which is unrealistic for practical applications.

Method: Introduce a new ergodic control formulation that uses a volumetric state representation, preserving asymptotic coverage guarantees and adding minimal computational overhead. This method supports arbitrary sample-based volumetric models.

Result: The new method improves coverage efficiency by more than a factor of two compared to standard ergodic control, maintains a 100% task completion rate across various tasks, robot dynamics, and end-effector/sensor models.

Conclusion: The proposed volumetric ergodic control formulation is effective and practical, outperforming the standard approach and demonstrated on a real-world robot arm task.

Abstract: Ergodic control synthesizes optimal coverage behaviors over spatial distributions for nonlinear systems. However, existing formulations model the robot as a non-volumetric point, but in practice a robot interacts with the environment through its body and sensors with physical volume. In this work, we introduce a new ergodic control formulation that optimizes spatial coverage using a volumetric state representation. Our method preserves the asymptotic coverage guarantees of ergodic control, adds minimal computational overhead for real-time control, and supports arbitrary sample-based volumetric models. We evaluate our method across search and manipulation tasks -- with multiple robot dynamics and end-effector geometries or sensor models -- and show that it improves coverage efficiency by more than a factor of two while maintaining a 100% task completion rate across all experiments, outperforming the standard ergodic control method. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a robot arm performing mechanical erasing tasks.
